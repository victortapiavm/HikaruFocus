# issue28-device-verify.sh -- the two sequences device QA failed on, run back to back.
#
# SEQUENCE A (FAIL 2, the caption): YouTube cold-launches onto Shorts, detection sets "shorts", the
#   user taps the in-app Home tab and uses the feed. The caption on the feed must be the GENERIC
#   items/taps label, never "shorts".
#
# SEQUENCE B (FAIL 1, the re-block): a grant is earned, the accessibility service is forced to
#   rebind, and the same app is brought forward again. There must be exactly ONE block -- a rebind is
#   not evidence the user went anywhere.
#
# Drives YouTube only. Never Instagram/TikTok/Threads (tools/qa/ig-walkthrough-capture.sh).
