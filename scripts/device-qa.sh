# device-qa.sh — Nudge's SCRIPTED release-gate device QA.
#
# Replaces the 60–100 minute LLM tap-walk that gated every release with a deterministic run
# that finishes in minutes, prints a PASS/FAIL table, and exits nonzero on any failure.
#
#   scripts/device-qa.sh            # every case (same as `all`)

#
# ── WHY MOST OF THIS IS NOT MAESTRO (the central design fact) ─────────────────
# Maestro — and every other UiAutomator-based driver — connects a `UiAutomation` session, and
# Android SUPPRESSES ALL OTHER ACCESSIBILITY SERVICES while one is connected (opting out needs
# `FLAG_DONT_SUPPRESS_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICES`, which Maestro does not pass). Nudge IS an
# accessibility service, so a Maestro flow silently DISABLES THE FEATURE UNDER TEST. Measured:
# during a Maestro session `Bound services:{}`, YouTube opens instantly, zero evaluation lines;
# the moment it exits, the same launch is blocked for 5s. See the long comment above `ui_dump`.
#
# So blocking behaviour is driven with plain ADB, and asserted against two non-invasive
# oracles — the foreground activity (`dumpsys activity activities`) and the service's own
# decision log (`block package=… reason=delay_rule delaySeconds=5`) — with `uiautomator dump`
# used only to read on-screen copy and to LOCATE tap targets at runtime (never fixed
# coordinates). `.maestro/nudge-setup.yaml` is the one Maestro flow kept, because it drives
# only Nudge's own UI (onboarding, Settings, backup import) where nothing needs to be blocked.
#
# ── Which APK is under test (APK=) ────────────────────────────────────────────
#   APK=main       (default) download `nudge-main.apk` from the rolling `main-latest`
#                  GitHub prerelease and install it. This is what CI built from main.
#   APK=release    download the APK asset of the `v<versionName>` release matching THIS working
#                  tree, and refuse to start if that release does not exist yet (CI may still be
#                  building it). NOT "the newest v* tag": while a tag is building, the newest
#                  release is the PREVIOUS version, which would silently downgrade the bench.
#   APK=installed  install nothing; drive whatever build is already on the device.
#                  This is the RELEASE-GATE mode: it validates the exact artefact a
#                  human/CI put on the bench.
#   APK=debug      build + install `assembleDebug` locally. Debug is signed with the DEBUG
#                  key, so over the bench's release build it needs ALLOW_CERT_SWITCH=1
#                  (below), and it leaves the bench unable to take any CI/release APK until
#                  switched back. The ONLY mode in which the `refusal-alert` case can
#                  run: its trigger receiver lives in `app/src/debug/` and does not
#                  exist in a release APK at all (see
#                  docs/architecture/service-lifecycle-and-watchdog.md).
#   APK=/path/to/app.apk  install that file.
#
# ── Signing key: the bench carries the RELEASE key (scripts/cert-guard.sh) ─────
#   Before installing, the installed APK's signer is compared with the incoming one. If they
#   differ the run REFUSES and changes nothing: Android cannot update across keys, so the only
#   way through is an uninstall that wipes the bench (2026-09-29: a silent APK=debug switch
#   broke every later CI install for the next lane).
#   ALLOW_CERT_SWITCH=1            opt in: uninstall, install, and say loudly that bench state
#                                  was wiped. Deliberate switch, and the way back:
#                                    APK=debug ALLOW_CERT_SWITCH=1 scripts/device-qa.sh refusal-alert
#                                    APK=main  ALLOW_CERT_SWITCH=1 scripts/device-qa.sh setup

#   QA_LOCK_OWNER=<name>           reuse a Pixel lock the caller already holds. ONLY works when
#                                  this script runs in the caller's own process tree:
#                                  `device-lock.sh` keys a holder on owner AND pid, and under
#                                  `nohup … &` the anchor pid differs, so the caller's own lock
#                                  is reported as "held by another agent" and the run dies at
#                                  step one. Backgrounded runs should simply let the script
#                                  take its own lock (it releases what it took, and leaves a
#                                  caller's lock alone).
#   EXPECT_VERSION_CODE=<n>        default: parsed from app/build.gradle.kts

# Element-located UI driving, and the logcat DECISION oracle
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT MAESTRO — read before "modernising" any of it.
#
# Maestro (and every other UiAutomator-based driver) connects a `UiAutomation` session, and
# Android SUPPRESSES ALL OTHER ACCESSIBILITY SERVICES for as long as one is connected unless
# the client passes `FLAG_DONT_SUPPRESS_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICES`, which Maestro's driver does
# not. Nudge IS an accessibility service. Measured on the bench, unambiguously:
#
#   during a Maestro session:  `Bound services:{}` · YouTube opens instantly ·
#                              ZERO evaluation lines in logcat · no block
#   after it exits:            service bound · YouTube blocked for 5s · 6 evaluation lines
#
# So a Maestro flow cannot observe Nudge blocking ANYTHING: it disables the feature under
# test. It fails as a flaky-looking assertion, which is presumably why this harness did not
# already exist. `.maestro/nudge-setup.yaml` is kept because it drives only Nudge's OWN UI
# (onboarding, Settings, the backup import) where no blocking is involved.
#
# A BARE `uiautomator dump` is a different matter and was measured too: the session is
# short-lived, `Bound services` stays populated across repeated dumps, and a block already on
# screen completes and grants passthrough normally. So reading the tree is safe; holding a
# driver session open is not.
#
# The oracle is therefore stronger than a text assertion would have been:
#   · `dumpsys activity activities` → which activity is in front (no a11y involved at all)
#   · logcat, e.g. `block package=… reason=delay_rule delaySeconds=5` from BlockEngine →
#     WHICH RULE fired, not merely that something appeared
#   · `uiautomator dump` → the on-screen copy, and the tap targets
# Taps are `input tap` at coordinates DERIVED AT RUNTIME from the dumped node's bounds —
# element-located, never hardcoded geometry.

# ── daily-limit-midsession (v1.18.4): the budget blocks while you are still IN the app ──
#
# "Daily limits should definitely be enforced even mid session" (product call, 2026-09-29). Before
# v1.18.4 they were not: the 30-second foreground clock was gated on
# `autoKickAfterMinutes != null || (showTimeRemaining && dailyLimitMinutes != null)`, so a plain
# budget was re-read by nothing and 150 seconds of continuous foreground time produced exactly ONE
# evaluation, at t=0. You could sit past your limit forever as long as you never switched away.
#
# ## Why this case DERIVES its limit instead of using the fixture's 1 minute
# The budget is OS-owned usage (`queryEvents`), so it is not reset by `pm clear` and it does not
# reset between runs. This case needs the opposite precondition to `daily-limit-refresh`: it must
# open the app with budget REMAINING and watch it run out. On any second run of the day the
# fixture's 1 minute is long gone, and a fixed number cannot express "a bit more than whatever
# Android has already recorded". So it reads the engine's own `dailyUsageMs` and sets the limit to
# `usage + 2 minutes` — always 60-120 seconds of real budget, whatever the phone has been doing.
#
# ## Why the wait is one TICK longer than the budget, not "+20s"
# Enforcement is as cheap as it is because it rides the clock that already exists, and that clock
# ticks every `FOREGROUND_TICK_MS` (30s). So a block can legitimately land up to one tick after the
# budget crosses zero — the same overshoot the time-based auto-kick documents. The wait is
# `remaining + 45s`, and anything longer than that is a real failure rather than slack.
#
# ## The oracles, and why the UI tree is NOT read while sitting
# A bare `uiautomator dump` is safe (measured: `Bound services` survives it), but this case's whole
# subject is a 30-second clock inside the accessibility service, and polling a `UiAutomation`
# session against it is the one thing this harness refuses to do on principle. So the sit is watched
# entirely through non-invasive channels:
#   · logcat: `block package=… reason=daily_limit_reached source=foreground_clock` — the service
#     saying the budget ran out, on the clock path, which the engine's re-entry
#     `reason=time_budget_exceeded` deliberately does not share a substring with.
#   · `dumpsys activity activities`: sampled to prove we never left the app (a block that only
#     happens because something bounced us out is the OLD behaviour passing a new test).
# The tree is read ONCE, after the block, for the on-screen copy.
#
# ## The second half: enforcement keeps working, counting does not repeat
# The limit screen is pushed back behind the app WITHOUT going home, which is the same sitting
# (Nudge's own overlay is not a departure — `BlockLaunchGate.arrivalAfterSignal`). The user must meet
# the block again and the Blocked count must NOT move, which is issue #36's invariant on a path that
# is now driven by a timer. Total delta for the whole episode: exactly +1.
