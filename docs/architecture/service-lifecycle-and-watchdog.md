# Service lifecycle and the protection watchdog

Covers what keeps Nudge's enforcement alive, what notices when it dies, and how the user finds out.
**Read before touching `NudgeMonitorService`, `BootReceiver`, `ProtectionWatchdogWorker`,
`ProtectionCheck`, `ProtectionStatus`, `AccessibilityConnectionSignal`, `NudgeApp`, `MainActivity`,
or the permission rows on the Settings screen.**

## The defect this subsystem was built out of

Our first Play review was 3 stars, *"It doesn't work sometimes"* (Redmi Note 14, Android 16), and
[issue #23](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/23) reported the accessibility service dying
overnight **with battery restrictions already disabled**. The 2026-09-06 resilience audit found the
mechanism, and it needed no OEM involvement at all:

- `NudgeMonitorService.start()` had **exactly one call site in the whole codebase**: `BootReceiver`,
  on `BOOT_COMPLETED`. `MainActivity` never started it. The master toggle never started it.
  Completing onboarding never started it. `stop()` had zero call sites.
- The manifest declared **one** receiver action, `BOOT_COMPLETED`. There was no
  `ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`.
- **Nothing anywhere ever asked whether the app was still working.** No `WorkManager`, no
  `AlarmManager`, no `JobScheduler` — zero hits across `app/src`.
- The Settings screen read all three permissions with `remember { mutableStateOf(...) }`: one shot
  at first composition, never again.

So: Play auto-updates Nudge overnight → the in-place update makes Android disable the accessibility
service → no foreground service is running to notice → nothing restarts either → and the Settings
screen keeps displaying a green tick over a dead service. Blocking silently stops until the user
reboots. Then it works. Then it stops again at the next update. We shipped six releases between
19 and 31 August 2026, so our own release cadence was firing this at users.

MIUI does not have to do anything exotic to produce that review. It only has to win a fight we
never turned up to. What MIUI adds is frequency, plus a force-stop that defeats `START_STICKY`
outright, plus (per the OEM research) revoking the accessibility grant *as a consequence of* killing
the process — which is why it stays dead until the user re-toggles it by hand.

## The three parts

### 1. Real start paths for the foreground service

`NudgeMonitorService` holds process priority. It does not monitor anything (the accessibility
binding is what enforces), so its value is entirely in existing — and it now exists whenever
monitoring should be live:

| Moment | Where |
|---|---|
| App launch with monitoring on | `MainActivity.keepMonitorServiceInSync()` |
| Master toggle switched on **or off** | same observer — the flag is the thing being watched |
| Onboarding completing | same observer — it writes `onboardingComplete` without leaving the Activity |
| Device reboot | `BootReceiver`, `ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED` |
| App update | `BootReceiver`, `ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED` |
| A dead service found by the watchdog | `ProtectionWatchdogWorker` |

The first three are **one observer**, not three call sites, because all three are a change in the
same pair of flags (`isGlobalEnabled && isOnboardingComplete`) while `MainActivity` is on screen.
Gating on onboarding too means a first-run user is never shown an ongoing notification claiming
Nudge is monitoring before they have granted it anything to monitor with.

Two invariants, both pinned by `ServiceLifecycleContractTest`:

- **The receiver guard is a membership test.** It used to be
  `if (intent.action != Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED) return`. An inequality against ONE action
  means adding a second action to the manifest compiles, ships, and silently does nothing.
- **`NudgeMonitorService.start()` returns a Boolean and swallows `IllegalStateException`.** Android
  12+ forbids starting a foreground service from the background, and the watchdog does exactly
  that. Nudge normally qualifies for the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` exemption, but onboarding lets that
  permission be skipped, and then `startForegroundService` throws
  `ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException`. An uncaught throw in the one component whose job is
  noticing failure would be its own silent death.

**`start()` returns early when `isRunning` is already true** (v1.18.3). Its KDoc had said "starts
the service if it is not already running" since the day it was written and nothing implemented it,
so every caller re-entered `onStartCommand` — and `onStartCommand` has to call `startForeground`,
which is a notification post. See *The notification is posted on change* below for why that
mattered. This does not weaken the watchdog: `ProtectionCheck` only calls `start()` when the
snapshot already says the service is dead, i.e. when `isRunning` is false.

`NudgeMonitorService.isRunning` is a `@Volatile` static set in `onStartCommand` and cleared in
`onDestroy`. A static is the *honest* signal here precisely because it dies with the process: the
failure being watched for is the OS killing us, and a killed process comes back with it false.
(`getRunningServices()` has been restricted since API 26; a heartbeat timestamp would be this flag
with extra I/O.)

### 2. The watchdog

`ProtectionWatchdogWorker` is a `WorkManager` periodic worker on the 15-minute floor, enqueued
`KEEP` from `NudgeApp.onCreate()` — the one callback that runs on **every** process start, so it
re-arms itself after a boot, an update, and any kill WorkManager itself recovers from. `KEEP` and
not `REPLACE`: replacing the request on every launch would push the next run 15 minutes out each
time, so the user who opens Nudge most would be checked least.

**Not `AlarmManager`.** An exact alarm needs `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` (a Play-review surface) and is
rate-limited on Android 14+, for a check whose tolerance is a quarter of an hour.

The signal is **two reads, not one** (`ProtectionStatus`). Membership in
`Settings.Secure.ENABLED_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICES` is the user's INTENT; membership in the system's
bound list (`AccessibilityManager.getEnabledAccessibilityServiceList`) is REALITY, and the gap
between them is the failure. Verified against AOSP master: when an accessibility service's process
is killed, `binderDied()` puts the component in `mCrashedServices`, `updateServicesLocked()`
`continue`s past it forever, and it is left in the settings string. A watchdog built on that string
alone would sit reading "enabled, all good" through the entire failure it was written to catch. Only
a force-stop or a user toggle strips the component.

Between them the two reads still cover every root cause (a memory kill, MIUI's revoke-on-kill, an
update-disable, a user switching it off), so no OEM-specific detection code is needed, only
OEM-specific *messaging* later.

The check body lives in `ProtectionCheck`, not in the worker, because **WorkManager cannot be made
to run the worker on demand** (see "How to test this" below). The worker is the schedule,
`ProtectionCheck` is the check, `ProtectionWatchdog` is the policy.

The policy lives in `domain/health/ProtectionWatchdog`, a **pure function**, because the failure it
exists for (a phone quietly switching Nudge off overnight) is not reproducible on a device.
`ProtectionCheck` gathers the values and carries out the verdict; it holds no policy of its own, and
`ServiceLifecycleContractTest` asserts it does not grow one.

| State | What happens |
|---|---|
| Master toggle off | Silence, and any stale alert is dismissed. **Never nag a user who opted out.** |
| Everything alive | Silence, alert dismissed |
| Accessibility disabled (not in the settings string) | Notify on the **first** sighting — we cannot re-grant it, so waiting a cycle buys nothing and costs 15 more minutes of unblocked scrolling |
| Accessibility granted but not bound | Notify on the **second consecutive** sighting, with its own copy ("turn it off and back on"). One confirming cycle separates a genuinely crashed service from one legitimately mid-bind: `mBindingServices` is not `mBoundServices`, so a check landing seconds after a boot or an update sees the same thing |
| Foreground service dead, accessibility alive | **Restart it silently.** Blocking still works, so "protection has stopped" would be a lie |
| Foreground service still dead next cycle | Notify — the restart did not hold, which is a phone actively shutting Nudge down, and that the user *can* act on |
| Foreground service dead and the platform **refused** the restart | Silent on the first sighting, then `MONITOR_START_BLOCKED` — see *A refused start is a fault of its own* below. It supersedes the row above on the cycle where both are true, because it names a fix the user can perform |

A **12-hour cooldown** sits over both alerts. A phone that keeps killing us would otherwise produce
an alert every 15 minutes for as long as it stays broken, and a notification the user learns to
swipe away is worth less than no notification at all. A clock moved backwards resets the cooldown
rather than muting until wall-clock catches up.

It has to be a **push notification, not an in-app banner.** An app blocker's whole point is to be
invisible until it is needed, so the user has no organic reason to open Nudge — a banner would have
left issue #23's reporter blind all night and into the next day. `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` was already
declared but had never been *requested*: it is a runtime grant from Android 13, so without the
request in `MainActivity` both this alert and the ongoing monitor notification are dropped on the
floor on exactly the modern devices this protects. The alert uses its own channel, so muting the
permanent silent one does not mute this.

Tapping it lands in Nudge's own Settings screen, **not** straight in the system accessibility list:
that screen carries the Play-mandated prominent-disclosure dialog, and this app has been rejected
once on that gate already (`docs/play-store.md`).

### 3. Settings shows live truth

The permission rows track reality through three refresh paths, because the accessibility answer has
two halves that change at different moments and the other two permissions have no watchable key at
all:

1. A `ContentObserver` on `ProtectionStatus.ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICES_URI`, which fires the instant the
   enabled-services setting changes (a user toggle, a force-stop) even while this screen is on top.
2. `AccessibilityConnectionSignal`, raised from the accessibility service's own `onServiceConnected`
   and `onDestroy`.
3. An `ON_RESUME` recheck of all three permissions, the only path available to overlay and
   usage-stats, which are `AppOpsManager` modes with nothing to observe.

**Why (2) exists.** The settings string is written when the toggle flips; the system binds the
service *afterwards*, asynchronously (`updateServicesLocked` then `bindServiceAsUser`, the component
sitting in `mBindingServices` until `onServiceConnected` lands). So the observer in (1) fires during
that gap and reads granted-but-not-connected, which is byte-for-byte the crashed state. That is a
momentary wrong tick only if something reads again, and while the screen stays resumed, nothing did:
`ON_RESUME` never fires for a re-enable from a split window, from `adb shell settings put`, or from
a quick-settings tile. The stale reading **latched**, and device QA watched the red cross and the
"turn it off and back on" copy sit there for 20+ seconds over a service `dumpsys accessibility` had
shown bound within 3. It would not have healed on its own.

The fix is the event, not a timer. `onServiceConnected` IS the bind completing: the earliest correct
moment to look again, no interval to tune, no wakeups when nothing is happening. The signal only
says "look again" - the answer still comes from `ProtectionStatus`, which asks the framework. (A
static flag would be the mistake `NudgeMonitorService.isRunning` is documented as deliberately not
making for the watchdog. It is usable here only because the UI asks a different question, "has
something changed", of a process that is by definition alive to ask it.)

`LivePermissionStateContractTest` pins all of it, because a one-shot read is a defect in *where* the
code is, not in any value a JVM test can inspect.

The screen also no longer rolls its own accessibility read. It used to ask
`enabledServices.contains(context.packageName)` — a substring test that says yes for any component
of ours and for any package whose name merely contains ours. Both it and the watchdog now go
through `ProtectionStatus`, so they cannot disagree. Note the two package names in play:
`applicationId` is `dev.astraedus.nudge` and `namespace` is `com.astraedus.nudge`, so any matcher
assuming the class is a child of the package is wrong here.

## How to test this

The watchdog's detection half is verifiable by hand; its **notification half was not**, and shipped
once without ever having been seen to fire. `adb shell cmd jobscheduler run -f dev.astraedus.nudge
<jobId>` prints "Running job [FORCED]" and a `jobFinished` about 12ms later, but `doWork()` never
executes: no `WM-WorkerWrapper: Worker result` line is ever emitted (reproduced three times on the
Pixel 3). WorkManager will not run a periodic worker early. So the only way to watch the alert was
to be holding the phone through two consecutive natural cycles while the accessibility service
happened to be dead, and the one divergence device QA managed to reproduce self-healed first.

Hence `WatchdogDebugReceiver`: a **debug-build-only** broadcast that runs one check synchronously.
It calls `ProtectionCheck.run` and nothing else, so it exercises the exact code the 15-minute
schedule runs. It lives in `app/src/debug/`, class and manifest entry both, so it does not exist in
a release APK at all; `WatchdogDebugTriggerContractTest` fails if either half leaks into `src/main`,
or if the receiver ever grows a signal read or a decision of its own.

### Running one check

```bash
adb shell am broadcast \
  -a dev.vtap.hikarufocus.debug.RUN_WATCHDOG \
  -n dev.vtap.hikarufocus/com.astraedus.nudge.service.WatchdogDebugReceiver
```

The explicit `-n` component is required, not decoration: a custom action is an *implicit* broadcast,
and manifest-declared receivers have not received those since API 26. Note the two package names
(`applicationId` is `dev.vtap.hikarufocus`, `namespace` is `com.astraedus.nudge`) - the component is
one of each.

The verdict comes back in the broadcast result, so you read the DECISION rather than inferring it
from whether a notification appeared:

```
Broadcast completed: result=0, data="global=true granted=true connected=false monitorRunning=true
wasDegraded=true | notify=ACCESSIBILITY_CRASHED dismiss=false startService=false degradedNow=true
reported=ACCESSIBILITY_CRASHED"
```

Same line on logcat under tag `ProtectionWatchdog`.

**`notify=` and `reported=` are different fields and the difference is the point.** `notify=` is
what `ProtectionWatchdog.decide` concluded from the snapshot alone; `reported=` is what the user
was actually told, after the foreground-service start was attempted and possibly refused (#62,
below). They agree on every cycle where nothing was refused. When they disagree, a
` (service start REFUSED by platform)` suffix is appended and `reported=` is the field that
matches the notification in the shade.

Two extras stage persisted inputs that a real earlier cycle would have written. They are fixtures,
not a second code path - both go through the same `recordProtectionCheck` the check itself uses:

| Extra | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--ez reset true` | Clears the degraded flag and the 12-hour alert cooldown. Without it, a state can only be re-tested twice a day. |
| `--ez degraded true` | Marks the previous check as degraded, satisfying the confirming-cycle rule in one broadcast. Sending the broadcast twice is more faithful and is preferred; this is for a fault that is only briefly reproducible. |

### Forcing each state

The master toggle is Nudge's own switch on the Home screen. `X` below is the accessibility component
`dev.astraedus.nudge/com.astraedus.nudge.service.NudgeAccessibilityService`.

| State | How to force it | Expected verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Healthy** | Master toggle on, accessibility on. Confirm with `adb shell dumpsys accessibility \| grep -E "Enabled services\|Bound services"` - our component must be in BOTH. | `notify=none dismiss=true degradedNow=false` |
| **Monitoring off** | Master toggle off in the app. | `global=false notify=none dismiss=true` - never nag a user who opted out. |
| **Granted but not connected** (`ACCESSIBILITY_CRASHED`) | `adb shell am crash dev.astraedus.nudge` produces the state, but on an idle device it heals in 150ms-3s - see "What could NOT be verified" below before spending time here. Confirm with `adb shell dumpsys accessibility \| grep -E "Enabled services\|Bound services\|Crashed services"`: ours under Enabled, absent from Bound. | First broadcast: `connected=false notify=none degradedNow=true`. **Second**: `notify=ACCESSIBILITY_CRASHED`. Unverified on device to date. |
| **User-disabled** (`ACCESSIBILITY_DISABLED`) | Turn the toggle off in system Settings, or `adb shell settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services ""` - **record the old value first** (`settings get secure enabled_accessibility_services`), that key holds every service on the device, not just ours. | `granted=false notify=ACCESSIBILITY_DISABLED` on the FIRST broadcast - we cannot re-grant it, so waiting a cycle only costs the user 15 more minutes. |
| **Foreground service dead** (`MONITOR_SERVICE_DEAD`) | Same `am crash`; `NudgeMonitorService.isRunning` is a static, so it comes back false in the new process. Reachable only with accessibility healthy, since the fault order is granted, then connected, then service. | First: `startService=true`. Second, if the restart did not hold: `notify=MONITOR_SERVICE_DEAD`. |

A fresh run of a two-cycle state is therefore: broadcast with `--ez reset true`, then broadcast plain.

### Three ways the broadcast returns no verdict (none of them mean the trigger is broken)

Device QA hit all three. `result=0` with **no `data=`** is the shared symptom, and it looks exactly
like the receiver not existing, so check these before concluding the trigger is dead:

1. **Two `am crash`es on the same process within ~90 seconds poisons broadcast delivery to it for
   minutes.** AMS logs `BroadcastQueue: Timeout of broadcast` and `Crashing app skipping ANR`, the
   broadcast hangs for the full 60s timeout, and no result data comes back. It persists after the
   accessibility service itself has healed, so it is an AMS-level state about the process, not
   anything to do with this check. Only `am force-stop` plus a relaunch clears it. **Discipline: one
   `am crash` per force-stop/relaunch cycle.**
2. **Broadcasting at t+0 after a crash** can reach a receiver that runs before the process is ready
   to complete it, and no result data is set.
3. Genuinely not installed: `adb shell dumpsys package dev.astraedus.nudge | grep -A5
   WatchdogDebugReceiver` shows nothing. That is the real failure, and it means a release build.

### What could NOT be verified on the bench, and why

`ACCESSIBILITY_CRASHED` has never been observed firing on a device, after eight attempts across
several fault-injection strategies. Not because the logic is wrong: **on an idle Pixel 3 the
accessibility service rebinds in 150ms to 3s after `am crash`, and `Crashed services` empties with
it, faster than an `am broadcast` round trip.** QA could prove the granted-but-unbound state exists
(repeatedly, via `dumpsys accessibility`) and could prove the posting pipeline works (the sibling
`ACCESSIBILITY_DISABLED` and `MONITOR_SERVICE_DEAD` faults both posted real notifications on
`nudge_protection_alerts` through the identical `notify()` body), but never got the two to coincide.
Even a 50ms on-device poll that fired the broadcast the instant `dumpsys` showed `Bound services:{}`
had the service back by the time the receiver evaluated.

**Do not "fix" this with a fake fault or a QA hold that bypasses the check.** A trigger that runs
different code than production is the failure mode this whole file exists to avoid. What this
observation actually tells us is more useful than a green tick would have been:

- The 10+ minute stuck-unbound state a previous QA run recorded is real, but it is NOT what `am
  crash` on an idle device produces. The field cause is a low-memory kill or an OEM force-stop with
  the screen off, where nothing is trying to restart us. That is not reproducible on the bench.
- **The two-strike rule on this fault is therefore load-bearing, not a formality.** It is what stops
  us alerting on a crash the system heals within seconds. If it were removed, this device would post
  a false "your phone broke Nudge" on every transient.
- Because the state self-heals so readily, `ACCESSIBILITY_CRASHED` should be rare in the field. That
  is the design working, not the alert failing.

The residual risk is the copy, not the delivery: a crashed user's switch already reads ON, so being
told the permission is off would send them nowhere. `ProtectionAlertCopyTest` pins the fault-to-copy
mapping over the whole `ProtectionFault` enum, so a new fault cannot ship without copy and the
crashed message cannot drift into the grant prompt.

### Asserting the notification

```bash
adb shell dumpsys notification --noredact | grep -B2 -A12 nudge_protection_alerts
```

What to check:

- **Posted**: a record with `pkg=dev.astraedus.nudge`, `id=2`, `channel=nudge_protection_alerts`.
  Id 1 is the permanent monitor notification and is not this. The channel is separate on purpose:
  a user who mutes the silent ongoing one must not thereby mute this.
- **Copy matches the fault**: `ACCESSIBILITY_CRASHED` says turn it off and back on, and must NEVER
  show the "grant the permission" copy - that user's switch already reads on, and telling them to
  turn on what is already on is how a safety notification gets muted.
- **Not posted**: no such record. Nothing about a healthy check or a disabled master toggle may
  produce one.
- **Dismissed**: run a healthy check while an alert is showing; the record disappears (the decision
  line will read `dismiss=true`).

If a check returns `notify=<FAULT>` and no record appears, the decision is fine and the POST is
being dropped - check `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (`adb shell dumpsys package dev.astraedus.nudge | grep
POST_NOTIFICATIONS`). That distinction is exactly why the verdict is returned in the broadcast
result and not inferred from the shade.

## A refused start is a fault of its own ([#62](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/62), v1.18.3)

The bench Pixel 3's dropbox held `system_server_wtf` entries for a **denied foreground-service
background start** of `NudgeMonitorService`. Not a crash, and not new: `start()` has always caught
`ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException` and returned `false`. The gap was everything after
that. `ProtectionCheck` logged it at w-level and carried on, so on a phone where the start is
always refused the watchdog could never heal the service, and **nothing told the user** that the
one component whose job is noticing failure was itself missing an arm.

### Which exemptions we actually have

Verified against the platform's own list (*Foreground service launch restrictions*, API 31+):

| Path | Exempt? |
|---|---|
| `MainActivity` visible / recently foreground | **Yes** |
| `BOOT_COMPLETED`, `LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED` | **Yes** — so `BootReceiver` is fine |
| User interacting with our notification or widget | **Yes** |
| `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` granted | **Yes**, but see below |
| Battery optimization turned off for us | Yes — but we deliberately do not ask (Play-policy risk, *Deliberately NOT built here*) |
| A **bound AccessibilityService** | **No.** Do not "fix" a refusal by starting the service from `onServiceConnected`; that is a second silently refused path |
| A WorkManager **expedited** job | **No.** Promoting the watchdog worker would change nothing |

So `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` is the only exemption the watchdog has ever run under, and onboarding
lets that permission be skipped. **Android 16 narrows it further, to apps with a currently VISIBLE
overlay window** — holding the grant stops being sufficient there. This fault is therefore on its
way from "a misconfigured minority" to "the ordinary case", which is the argument for surfacing it
rather than logging it. There is **no API to ask in advance** whether a start would be allowed:
attempt and catch is the only available shape.

### Where the decision lives

`decide()` cannot answer this, because whether a start will be refused is only knowable once one
has been attempted. So there is a **second pure step**, `ProtectionWatchdog.faultToReport(snapshot,
decision, startRefused)`, and `ProtectionCheck` calls it after the attempt and posts from its
result instead of from `decision.notifyOf`. Putting an `if (refused) notify(...)` in
`ProtectionCheck` instead would have duplicated the confirming-cycle and cooldown rules into the
one place no unit test can reach — the invariant `ServiceLifecycleContractTest` already pins.

Its rules, and why each exists:

- **Nothing refused: return `decision.notifyOf` unchanged.** This function is on the path of every
  check, so the common case has to be byte-identical to the behaviour that shipped before it.
- **Master toggle off: silence.** A refusal must not become a back door around *never nag a user
  who opted out*.
- **An accessibility fault outranks it.** `ACCESSIBILITY_DISABLED` / `ACCESSIBILITY_CRASHED` mean
  blocking is ACTUALLY dead, which is worse, and their recoveries bring the service back anyway.
- **One confirming cycle**, exactly as `MONITOR_SERVICE_DEAD` has. `isRunning` is in-process only,
  so the FIRST check after ANY process start reports the service dead and attempts a start;
  alerting on that single sighting would fire on every boot and every update.
- **The same 12-hour cooldown, and the same persisted timestamp.** A phone in this state refuses
  every restart, so a second clock would drift out of step with the first and double the noise.
  `ProtectionCheck` therefore advances the cooldown on the fault it POSTED, not on the verdict.

### Two things heal it, and they are a designed pair

`MainActivity` now retries the start on **every resume** when monitoring should be on and
`NudgeMonitorService.isRunning` is false. The existing `keepMonitorServiceInSync()` observer could
not do this: it is `distinctUntilChanged` over two flags, so opening the app with the flags
unchanged emits nothing, and the user sat looking at an app whose service was dead. Gating the
retry on `isRunning` matters too — an unconditional `sync()` per resume would re-post the ongoing
notification, which is #63.

Because the alert's tap target is `MainActivity`, **tapping the notification is itself a legal
foreground moment and restarts the service**, on every API level, before the user does anything
about the permission. Neither the tap destination nor the resume observer may be changed without
the other.

### The copy, and what it may not promise

`protection_alert_blocked_title` / `_body`, stem `protection_alert_blocked`, pinned by
`ProtectionAlertCopyTest` (which iterates the real enum, so the new fault could not ship without
copy). It leads with *opening Nudge restarts it* — true on every version — and offers "Display over
other apps" as what lets Nudge do it unattended. Neither sentence is a promise, because on Android
16 the grant alone is not sufficient. The onboarding and Settings permission rows carry the same
cost in the same honest shape, gated by `OverlayPermissionCopyTest`.

### Reproducing it on the bench

```bash
adb shell appops set dev.astraedus.nudge SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW deny
adb shell am force-stop dev.astraedus.nudge
adb shell am broadcast -a dev.astraedus.nudge.debug.RUN_WATCHDOG \
  -n dev.astraedus.nudge/com.astraedus.nudge.service.WatchdogDebugReceiver --ez reset true
# first: startService=true, reported=none, "(service start REFUSED by platform)"
adb shell am broadcast -a dev.astraedus.nudge.debug.RUN_WATCHDOG \
  -n dev.astraedus.nudge/com.astraedus.nudge.service.WatchdogDebugReceiver
# second: reported=MONITOR_START_BLOCKED, and a notification on nudge_protection_alerts
```

Then open Nudge: the resume retry starts the service, and
`adb shell dumpsys activity services dev.astraedus.nudge | grep NudgeMonitorService` shows it
running again. Restore with `appops set ... allow`.

**That recipe does not work as written on the bench Pixel 3 (API 31), measured 2026-09-29** while
scripting `refusal-alert` in `scripts/device-qa.sh`. Two facts fight each other:

- **`am force-stop` does not merely unbind the accessibility service — it prunes our component out
  of `enabled_accessibility_services`**, the same pruning `pm clear` triggers. So the very next
  broadcast arrives with `granted=false`, and `faultToReport` correctly answers
  `ACCESSIBILITY_DISABLED`, which **outranks** a refused start by design. Observed:
  `cycle 1: granted=false … reported=ACCESSIBILITY_DISABLED (service start REFUSED by platform)`,
  then `cycle 2: reported=none` because cycle 1 had already spent the 12-hour cooldown.
- **Re-granting accessibility to get past that heals the service.** `onServiceConnected` starts the
  monitor and on this device that start SUCCEEDS even with `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` denied — three
  consecutive runs returned `granted=true connected=true monitorRunning=true … notify=none
  dismiss=true`, i.e. perfectly healthy, with no refused start left to report. (Which is also a
  caution about the exemption table above: whatever the documented rule, on API 31 the rebind path
  got its foreground-service start through.)

So the state this fault describes is **not reachable on the bench by this route** — the same honest
dead end recorded for `ACCESSIBILITY_CRASHED` above, and the same rule applies: do NOT fake the
fault or add a QA-only hold to force it. `scripts/device-qa.sh`'s `refusal-alert` therefore reports
**SKIP with that reason** when the snapshot comes back healthy, and FAILs only when the state WAS
reached and the verdict is still wrong. The alert itself stays pinned by `ProtectionAlertCopyTest`
(iterates the real enum, so a fault cannot ship without copy) and `ServiceLifecycleContractTest`.
If you want this covered on a device, the missing ingredient is a way to keep the monitor service
dead while accessibility is alive — not a louder assertion.

## The notification is posted on CHANGE, and health is re-evaluated on EVENTS ([#63](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/63), v1.18.3)

A user on a Pixel 10 Pro / Android 17 read his own battery with BetterBatteryStats and sent us the
measurement: over **10h24m**, `NotificationManagerService:post:dev.astraedus.nudge` had been taken
**267 times** — about once every 2.3 minutes, all of it while the phone was trying to sleep — for
2m49s of user time plus 1m49s of system time and repeated Deep Doze interruptions. He also reported
the tell that named the mechanism outright: *swipe the permanent notification away and it is back
within seconds, with no changing text.*

There is no platform-side dedup to hide behind. `NotificationManagerService.enqueueNotification`
takes its post wakelock before it has looked at the content, so a byte-identical re-post costs
exactly what a real one costs. Nothing but the app can tell "nothing changed".

**Three separate paths were posting, and all three are closed:**

| Path | What it was | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| The health poll | `manager.notify(...)` every 30s, unconditionally — 1200+ a night | `StatusNotificationGate` holds the fingerprint of the copy on screen; `publishHealth` posts only when it differs |
| Every redundant `start()` | `startForegroundService` re-runs `onStartCommand`, which must call `startForeground`, which is a post | `start()` returns early when `isRunning` |
| `isGlobalEnabled` re-emitting | DataStore's `data` flow re-emits the whole snapshot on a write to **any** key; `NudgeAccessibilityService` collects it and calls `sync` on each emission — so `ProtectionCheck`'s own per-cycle write posted the notification | `distinctUntilChanged` on `isGlobalEnabled` and `isOnboardingComplete` in `NudgePreferences` |

The third is the one worth remembering: a file with no clock in it was posting on a schedule,
driven by a write in a different subsystem. Nothing may now depend on those two flows re-emitting
an unchanged value — that was never a signal, only a side effect of which key someone else wrote.

### Event first, timeout second

`HEALTH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` went from **30 seconds to 5 minutes**, and is now a backstop rather than
the mechanism. The original justification here — "poll rather than observe: the system unbound our
service fires no callback we can receive in a process that was not running at the time" — is true,
and it is an argument for `ProtectionWatchdogWorker`, not for a timer inside a process that *is*
running. In a live process the unbind DOES fire a callback: `AccessibilityConnectionSignal`, raised
from the accessibility service's own `onServiceConnected` and `onDestroy` (the same signal the
Settings screen already uses, part 3 above). The master toggle is a Flow. So the service now waits
on `merge(connection signal, master toggle)` with `withTimeoutOrNull(HEALTH_POLL_INTERVAL_MS)`, and
both sources are filtered against **what the last evaluation saw** rather than dropped by position —
otherwise a change landing between finishing an evaluation and starting to listen again would be
slept through for the whole interval.

Two properties this relies on, both verified rather than assumed:

- A `kotlinx.coroutines.delay` holds no wakelock and schedules no alarm. It does not wake a dozing
  phone; it simply does not fire until the CPU is up for some other reason. The delay was never the
  Doze breaker — the `notify()` inside each tick was.
- Dismissal on Android 14+ does **not** stop a foreground service. `FLAG_ONGOING_EVENT` stopped
  preventing swipe-dismiss in Android 14, so the user genuinely can clear this notification, and the
  service keeps running and keeps enforcing.

### The swipe is answered with silence, deliberately

When a user dismisses the ongoing notification we do **not** re-post it. Blocking does not depend on
it, the service is unaffected, and re-posting is precisely the every-few-seconds resurrection the
bug report described. It returns on the next genuine state change — which is the only time it has
anything new to say. The gate therefore has no `reset()`: there is nothing that should clear it.

**Cost accepted:** alert latency on a fault that emits no event at all is now up to 5 minutes to the
first sighting instead of 30 seconds. There is no known reachable fault of that shape — disabling
the permission unbinds the service (an event), and a process kill takes this service with it (the
worker's job) — and the confirming-cycle faults were always going to cost a second sighting anyway.

### What the tests own

- `StatusNotificationGateTest` (**L1 pure JVM**) counts POSTS, not internal branches: 121 unchanged
  evaluations produce 1 post, and the **counterfactual** runs the pre-fix rule over the identical
  sequence through the identical driver and produces 121. A state flip produces exactly 1, and 500
  further identical evaluations after a dismissal produce 0.
- `MonitorServiceContractTest` owns what no JVM test can see — that the service still *asks*: there
  is exactly one `notify()` and it sits inside a `shouldPost()` branch, `onPosted` is recorded after
  it and never before, `startForeground` has exactly one call site, `start()` early-returns on
  `isRunning`, `isGlobalEnabled` is `distinctUntilChanged`, the connection signal is read, and the
  backstop interval is minutes rather than seconds. Each of those was confirmed to FAIL with the
  guard removed before being committed.

### Measuring it on a device

```bash
adb shell dumpsys notification --noredact | grep -c 'pkg=dev.astraedus.nudge'
```

Take that count, leave the phone idle with the screen off for ten minutes, take it again. The
delta must be **0** while nothing changes, and exactly **1** across a deliberate state flip (turn
the accessibility service off, or the master toggle). Before this change the same window produced
roughly twenty.

## Known limits (deliberate, not oversights)

- **Doze defers the check.** WorkManager periodic work runs in maintenance windows, so on a phone
  in deep idle overnight the alert may arrive in the morning rather than at 2am. Still infinitely
  better than never, and the alternative is an exact alarm with a Play-policy cost.
- **A killed process is now fully detected, but only after one confirming cycle.** The
  bound-services read sees it immediately; the confirming cycle is what separates a crashed service
  from one legitimately mid-bind, and costs up to 15 minutes. (This bullet used to claim Android
  re-binds a killed accessibility service and that the state was therefore only half-detectable.
  AOSP does not: `mCrashedServices` is never retried. That retracted claim is why the two-read
  design exists.) No official API distinguishes "OEM killed it" from "user turned it off", so the
  fault copy is inferred from which of the two lists lost us.
- **`isRunning` is in-process only.** That is the point (see above), but it means the first check
  after any process restart always reports the service dead, which is why a dead service is
  restarted silently and only notified about if it is *still* dead on the following run.

## Deliberately NOT built here

Each is a separate lane, and each has a real cost that has not been paid yet:

- `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` — genuine Play-policy risk, and issue #23 is direct
  evidence it would not have been sufficient anyway (that reporter had already disabled battery
  restrictions).
- Manufacturer-aware onboarding and autostart deep links (`com.miui.securitycenter`, Samsung's
  "never sleeping apps", …).
- The passthrough that survives screen-off, the background-activity-launch overlay fallback, the
  untested `isOverlayActive`/content-change seam, and the local diagnostics log. All are in
  `docs/BACKLOG.md` and in the resilience audit's fix order.

## The service's coroutine scope cannot take the process down (audit F7, v1.17.3)

Every block evaluation, every `UsageEvent` write and every DataStore collect in this app runs on
`NudgeAccessibilityService.serviceScope`. It was a bare `CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() +
Dispatchers.IO)`, which is the half of the answer everyone remembers: the supervisor stops one
failed child cancelling its siblings and does NOTHING about the exception itself. With no
`CoroutineExceptionHandler` in the context, an unhandled throwable in a root coroutine reaches the
thread's default uncaught-exception handler — and that kills the process, taking the
accessibility service with it, which means blocking stops entirely until the system rebinds. One
Room constraint violation is enough. Losing a stat row must never stop enforcement.

The scope is now a `util/CrashSafeScope`, which is the pattern `RecordWalkAwayUseCase` already
carried, extracted so it can be tested rather than eyeballed: the failure is logged at e-level with
the coroutine's name and swallowed. `CrashSafeScopeTest` asserts the outcomes and carries the
counterfactual that makes them mean something — the same throwing coroutine on a bare
`SupervisorJob` scope DOES reach the default uncaught handler, and on this one never does.

## Teardown cannot take the service down either ([#57](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/57), v1.18.2)

The sibling of F7 above, one callback later, and worse. `foregroundClock` is a `lateinit` that only
`onServiceConnected` assigns; `onDestroy` called `stopForegroundTimeTicker` unconditionally, and that
read it. So any teardown of a service that never completed a connect threw
`UninitializedPropertyAccessException` out of `onDestroy`, Android wrapped it as **"Unable to stop
service"**, and the component landed in `mCrashedServices` — which, per the retraction in *Known
limits* above, is **never retried**. Every rule became a silent no-op with nothing shown to the user.
The bench Pixel's dropbox held four of these traces, three on 1.18.1 and one on 1.18.0, so this had
been shipping for at least two releases. It was found while QAing #54 and presented as "the block
screen just did not appear", which cost several rounds chasing a phantom regression in unrelated code.

It is reachable from install-over / `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`, a force stop, a memory-pressure kill and
rebind (BACKLOG F8 records this service churning on the bench device under exactly that), or a user
toggling the permission quickly.

Two layers of fix, because the field guard alone only fixes the field:

- **Every `lateinit` teardown can reach is guarded**, the shape `hideAllOverlays` already used. There
  were **two**, not one: `endWebSession` reads `webClock.isRunning` even when `activeWebSessionKey`
  is already null, so it would have thrown in the same place the moment the clock above it was fixed.
- **`onDestroy` runs every statement through `ServiceTeardown`**, which contains and reports each
  step's failure by name. A throw in teardown can buy nothing — nothing after it can observe a
  failure — and it was costing both the crashed-service state and the steps *below* the throw:
  before this, the uninitialised clock on the third line meant `serviceScope` was never cancelled and
  all three overlay managers kept a dead service as their context. `Throwable`, not `Exception`: a
  `NoSuchMethodError` from an API-level mistake leaves the service equally crashed.

Ordering is the only thing left to get wrong, so the two load-bearing ones are pinned: the instance
is cleared **first** (anything reading connection state during the rest of teardown gets the truth)
and the scope is cancelled **last**.

`ServiceTeardownTest` owns the behaviour (a step throwing `UninitializedPropertyAccessException` does
not escape, and the steps after it still run). `ServiceTeardownContractTest` owns the invariant and
**discovers** it rather than listing it — it parses the service, computes which functions `onDestroy`
can actually reach, and requires a guard for every `lateinit` any of them touches, plus that
`onDestroy` holds nothing but contained steps. A new field, or a new call added to `onDestroy`, is
covered the day it is written. Both carry counterfactuals: removing either guard fails them.

**The watchdog already noticed this state, and that was checked rather than assumed.**
`ProtectionStatus.isAccessibilityServiceConnected` reads
`AccessibilityManager.getEnabledAccessibilityServiceList` — the server-side bound list, which a
crashed service is absent from — so `ProtectionCheck` raises the "blocking has stopped" alert on its
next cycle. The settings string, which survives a crash, is only ever read as *intent*. That is the
design the retraction in *Known limits* produced, and this bug is the first real-world case it was
built for. (`NudgeAccessibilityService.isConnected()`, the `instance != null` reading, has no
production callers — nothing user-facing hangs off it.)
