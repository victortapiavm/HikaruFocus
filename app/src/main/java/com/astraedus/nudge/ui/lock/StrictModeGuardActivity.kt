/**
 * Full-screen Strict Mode unlock challenge shown ON TOP of a protected Settings escape route
 * (the Nudge accessibility-service toggle, or Nudge's App Info / Force-stop / Uninstall page).
 *
 * Launched by [NudgeAccessibilityService.maybeGuardSettingsEscape] when Strict Mode is on and the
 * user has landed on one of those screens outside the post-unlock grace window.
 *
 * Outcomes (both safety-critical — the user must NEVER be trapped):
 *  - **Unlock** (typed the code): open a [StrictModeEscapeManager] grace window so the user can
 *    finish the disable they committed to without being re-challenged, then [finish] — which drops
 *    them back onto the Settings screen they were on.
 *  - **"I changed my mind" / back / dismiss**: send the user HOME via the accessibility service's
 *    [NudgeAccessibilityService.GLOBAL_ACTION_HOME] (with a HOME-intent fallback), bouncing them out
 *    of Settings, then [finish].
 *
 * The challenge string is freshly generated here (difficulty from prefs) and is always solvable.
