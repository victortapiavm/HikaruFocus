 * - [LockedToggle.STRICT_MODE]: turning the lock OFF weakens; turning it on is free.
 * - [LockedToggle.EMERGENCY_PASS]: turning the pass ON weakens (it re-opens a one-tap bypass on
 *   every block overlay); turning it off is free.
 *
 * The pass toggle is deliberately **not frozen** while Strict Mode is on (v1.10.0). Freezing it was
 * the old design and it also hid the pass from the overlays outright; now a user who opted into the
 * escape hatch keeps it, and re-opening it merely costs a challenge. Overlay visibility is governed
 * by the toggle alone (see `ui/overlay/resolveEmergencyPassState`).
