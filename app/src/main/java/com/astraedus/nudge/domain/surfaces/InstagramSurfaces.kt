/**
 * Instagram's surfaces, measured on **Instagram 447.0.0.55.81, Pixel 3, 1080x2160, 2026-09-22**.
 * The hierarchy dumps that back every constant below are committed, scrubbed, at
 * `app/src/test/resources/surface-fixtures/` and are replayed by the tests in this package.
 *
 * ## This file is the seam
 *
 * **Every `com.instagram.android:id/…` string in the codebase belongs here.** That is the point of
 * the adapter: when Instagram ships a release that renames a view, exactly one file changes, and
 * `InstagramIdsLiveInOneFileTest` fails the build if a second file starts carrying those ids.
 * (`service/InAppDetector.kt` is a grandfathered exception — it predates this seam and still holds
 * the reel-player container ids. It is the ONE legacy holder the test allows.)
 *
 * ## The measured facts, and what each one forced
 *
 * - `tab_bar` sits at `[0,1896][1080,2028]` and stays put while the feed scrolls. It is **absent**
 *   on the Following screen, in the reel player, and in stories and DM threads — which is exactly
 *   why its presence is a usable "a bottom-nav screen is showing" signal, and why the cover has to
 *   be torn down rather than left to float when it goes away.
 * - `clips_tab` sits at `[216,1896][432,2028]` with content-description "Reels".
 * - **Every tab reports `selected=false` in the dump, the active one included.** Nothing in this
 *   file, or anywhere downstream, may key on tab selection. The cover keys on `clips_tab` BOUNDS
 *   and nothing else.
 * - `title_logo` (ImageView, content-description "Instagram Home Feed") marks the Home feed, but it
 *   is NOT clickable. The clickable parent is `action_bar_title_view`, a ViewAnimator at
 *   `[132,97][948,210]` — so the steer's entry point is the parent, not the logo.
 * - The dropdown's rows are all `context_menu_item` (Button) with a `context_menu_item_label`
 *   (TextView) child reading "Following" or "Favorites". The row id cannot pick a row; the label can.
 * - Following is a SEPARATE full-screen activity: `action_bar_title` reads "Following", and
 *   `tab_bar`/`clips_tab`/`feed_tab` are gone from the tree entirely.
 * - **Deep links are dead.** `https://www.instagram.com/?variant=following` is claimed by the app
 *   but the parameter is ignored, and `instagram://feed?variant=following` does not resolve; both
 *   land on Home. The `variant-link` and `scheme-link` fixtures are the recorded proof. A click
 *   sequence is the only route, and no deep-link path exists in this adapter by design.

     * Classify one tree read into a [HostSurface].

     * The ladder, and the evidence for each rung:
     *
     * 1. **`action_bar_title` reads "Following" -> [HostSurface.FOLLOWING_FEED].** Following is its
     *    own full-screen activity whose header carries that exact string in both `text` and
     *    `contentDescription` (`following-feed`, `relaunch` fixtures). Checked FIRST because it is
     *    the only positive identification we have, and because a warm relaunch resumes here.
     *
     * 2. **`title_logo` present -> [HostSurface.HOME_FEED].** The logo is unique to the Home feed
     *    (`home`, `coldstart`, `variant-link`, `scheme-link`).
     *
     * 3. **`tab_bar` AND `sticky_header_list` present -> [HostSurface.HOME_FEED].** This rung is
     *    the scrolled Home feed, and it is here because the measured dumps forced it:
     *    `home-scrolled` has **no `title_logo`** — Instagram's action bar scrolls away with the
     *    content. Without this rung a scrolled feed falls to rung 4, reads as OTHER_TAB, resets the
     *    steer's `attempted` memory, and the user gets the menu opened under them again every time
     *    they scroll back to the top. `sticky_header_list` is present in all five Home dumps and in
     *    neither Following dump, which is as much as the spike can prove; no dump of Search,
     *    Messages or Profile was taken. The ordering is chosen so the unproven case fails SAFE: if
     *    some other tab also carries `sticky_header_list` it reads as Home, and the worst outcome is
     *    one steer attempt whose entry point does not exist, which times out and gives up silently.
     *    The reverse mistake — a scrolled Home read as another tab — is a visible re-steer loop.
     *
     * 4. **`tab_bar` present, nothing above matched -> [HostSurface.OTHER_TAB].** A bottom-nav
     *    screen that is positively not the Home feed.
     *
     * 5. **Otherwise -> [HostSurface.UNKNOWN].** The reel player, a story, a DM thread, settings.
     *    `tab_bar` is absent from all of them. We know nothing, so we change nothing.
     *
     * Note what is NOT here: tab selection. Every tab reports `selected=false` in the dump,
     * including the active one, so selection cannot answer any question this method is asked.
