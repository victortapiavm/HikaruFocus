     *    that happen to care: a branch-local update is precisely the shape that produced #5, #7,
     *    #19 and #28, each of which was a path that returned before something that had to happen.
     *  - [TabCoverOverlayManager] owns *is the cover over the Reels tab still over the app it was
     *    drawn for*. It is here for the same reason and not in the six branches that each mean "the
     *    user is somewhere else": a cover left behind is a black rectangle floating over the
     *    launcher, and there is no branch you can add one hide to that covers all of them. It
     *    delegates the whole decision to `TabCoverPresence`, which is exhaustive over
     *    [ForegroundSignal] with no `else`, so a signal added later cannot be forgotten here.
     *  - [BounceCheckIn] owns *which apps did the user open since they last hit a wall* (the
     *    "Bro. wtf." check-in, docs/architecture/bounce-check-in.md). A pure observer: it changes
     *    nothing about enforcement, and it is exhaustive over [ForegroundSignal] too.
     *
     * This method used to be called `applySitting`, which was accurate when the sitting was the only

     * ## The bug this closes ([#56](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/56))
     *
     * These two lines used to live in [hideAllOverlays], which the `ACTION_SCREEN_OFF` receiver
     * calls — carrying the comment *"the steer's 'already done this arrival' is about a visit that
     * has now ended"*. That is the exact premise
     * [#54](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/54) removed everywhere else: Android blanks
     * the display on lack of INPUT, not lack of attention, and the Pixel default is 30 seconds. So
     * read the Home feed for half a minute without touching the screen, let the display time out,
     * tap it back on — and the steer, freshly reset with Instagram still in front, dragged the user
     * off the feed they had deliberately chosen. 1.18.0's changelog promised the opposite: *"Nudge
     * will not drag you out of it again until your next visit."*
     *
     * The fix is not another rule about screen-offs. It is that the steer now takes its "this is a
     * new visit" verdict from **the same place the grant takes it from** — [onSittingEnded], i.e.
     * [com.astraedus.nudge.domain.sitting.SittingTracker]'s departure verdict, which already knows
     * that a blink is not a departure and that two minutes away is. #36, #54 and #64 were all one
     * subsystem holding two definitions of "the user left"; this is the third of them being
     * deleted rather than fixed in place. There is deliberately **no second timer here**.
     *
     * Also called when Nudge goes globally disabled, where the reasoning is the older one: a
     * disabled Nudge behaves as if uninstalled, so a memory of what it did inside someone else's
     * app has to go with it.
     *
     * [syntheticClicks] comes along because it is the same kind of state — a fact about what WE
     * just did — though moving it changes nothing observable: its window is one second and expires
     * on its own long before any of these callers fire.

     * The foreground clock says [packageName]'s daily budget has run out while the user is still
     * sitting in it (v1.18.4). RE-EVALUATE, and let the ordinary block path do the rest.
     *
     * ## Why this re-evaluates instead of launching the overlay itself
     * The clock's trigger is read off `CounterCacheRefresher`, which is a snapshot refreshed on a
     * 10-second timer -- so "the budget is spent" is a belief that can be up to ten seconds stale,
     * and acting on it directly is the [#50](https://github.com/astraedus/nudge/issues/50) shape:
     * a user who has just RAISED their limit (or switched the rule off) would be blocked with the
     * old one, from a timer, with nothing they did to trigger it. Asking
     * `EvaluateBlockUseCase` re-derives the answer from the database, which also means the schedule
     * window, the rule's enabled flag and the usage read are all the CURRENT ones.
     *
     * It also means there is exactly one enforcement path in this service: the reason the
     * daily-limit block wrote no `UsageEvent` for two versions (`docs/BACKLOG.md`) was that it was a
     * SECOND implementation of "block this app", and a second implementation is what drifts. The
     * row, the `claimConfrontation` arrival invariant, grayscale and the launch gate now come from
     * [handleDecision] for free.
     *
     * ## It may only ever ESCALATE to a HARD_BLOCK
     * If the rules no longer say hard-block, this does nothing at all -- and in particular it must
     * never act on a DELAY/HOLD/BREATHING answer. A budget that turns out NOT to be spent would
     * otherwise put a countdown in front of someone who is already inside the app and has done
     * nothing, which is a worse bug than the one this fixes. Same failure direction as the rest of
     * the clock: when the evidence has gone stale, do nothing.
