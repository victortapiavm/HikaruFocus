/**
 * Pins the two properties that make the QA trigger worth having, both of which are about WHERE the
 * code is rather than any value a unit test can inspect.
 *
 * 1. **It runs production's code.** The protection alert is user-facing safety machinery that had
 *    never once been observed firing: WorkManager will not run [ProtectionWatchdogWorker] early
 *    (`cmd jobscheduler run -f` finishes the job in ~12ms without `doWork()` executing), so the
 *    only way to see the alert was to be holding the phone across two consecutive natural cycles
 *    while the service happened to be dead. A trigger that re-derived the check would have made
 *    that worse, not better, it would go green while the shipping path stayed broken. Worker and
 *    trigger must both be one call to [ProtectionCheck].
 * 2. **It cannot ship.** The receiver is exported, because `am broadcast` runs as the shell uid.
 *    The guarantee that this does not become a release-build surface is that the class and its
 *    manifest entry live in the `debug` source set and are therefore absent from a release APK
 *    entirely, not a `BuildConfig.DEBUG` branch, which would still be present and still be
 *    reachable if the branch were ever edited away.
 *
 * These are source-level assertions on purpose: a JVM test cannot see a variant's merged manifest,
 * and a test that IMPORTED the debug-only receiver would not compile in the release unit-test
 * variant that `./gradlew test` also runs.
