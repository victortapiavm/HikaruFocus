/**
 * Source-level guard on the app's lifecycle wiring, in the same spirit as
 * `HomeScreenPassthroughContractTest` and `ScreenTimeSourceContractTest`: the defect was not in
 * any VALUE a unit test could inspect, it was in WHERE the code was — or rather, where it wasn't.
 *
 * The bug: `NudgeMonitorService.start()` had exactly ONE call site in the entire codebase, a
 * `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast, and the manifest declared no other action. So a fresh install ran
 * with no process-priority protection until the user's next reboot; a Play auto-update replaced
 * the process overnight and nothing brought it back; and nothing anywhere ever asked whether the
 * accessibility service was still enabled. Every failure was silent, and the app was strongest
 * right after a reboot and weakest right after every update.
 *
 * Value-level tests over [com.astraedus.nudge.domain.health.ProtectionWatchdog] pass just as
 * happily with every one of these call sites deleted. The wiring is what gets pinned here.
