/**
 * Every fault has copy, and the copy names the RIGHT recovery.
 *
 * This is the one alert the debug trigger could not make fire on the bench.
 * `ACCESSIBILITY_CRASHED` needs the system to be holding our service in the granted-but-unbound
 * state at the instant the check evaluates, and on an idle Pixel 3 the rebind completes in
 * 150ms-3s, which is faster than an `am broadcast` round trip. Device QA proved the state exists
 * (repeatedly, via `dumpsys accessibility`) and proved the posting pipeline works (the sibling
 * `ACCESSIBILITY_DISABLED` and `MONITOR_SERVICE_DEAD` faults both posted real notifications on
 * `nudge_protection_alerts` through the identical `notify()` body) - but never got the two to
 * coincide. So the remaining risk is not "does it post", it is "does it post the right words".
 *
 * That risk is worth a test on its own merits. The crashed user's Accessibility switch already
 * reads ON. Telling them their permission is off would send them looking for a toggle that is
 * already where the message says to put it, and telling them to "turn it back on" is worse than
 * useless - it is the instruction that makes them disable a service which, per AOSP, only a
 * deliberate off-and-on can revive. Wrong copy here costs the user the fix.
 *
 * Iterating the real enum rather than a hardcoded list is the point: a fault added later fails
 * this until someone writes its copy, instead of silently falling through to nothing.
