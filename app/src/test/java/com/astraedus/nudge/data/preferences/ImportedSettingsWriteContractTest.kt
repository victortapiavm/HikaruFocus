/**
 * Source-level guard for how an imported backup's settings are WRITTEN.
 *
 * `NudgePreferences` is not JVM-testable (Android `Context`, a DataStore delegate), and the two
 * invariants that matter here are not values a unit test could inspect — they are the SHAPE of the
 * write:
 *
 * 1. **All-or-nothing.** Every carried key goes inside ONE `dataStore.edit { }` block, which
 *    DataStore commits as a single transaction. Split across two `edit` calls, a restore could land
 *    `strictModeEnabled = false` without the challenge length that came with it — a protection
 *    state the user's backup never described. This is the same discipline the history restore has
 *    (one `insertAll`, pinned by `UsageRepositoryInsertEventsTest`).
 * 2. **A null field is SKIPPED, never written.** Absent is the format's word for "this file does not
 *    carry that setting", so the importing device must keep its own value. Writing a null through as
 *    a default would silently blank settings a partial or older backup simply said nothing about.
 *
 * Following the precedent of `BlockOverlayWalkAwayContractTest` and `ContentFilterAssetTest`: where
 * behaviour cannot be exercised, test the thing that actually goes wrong.
